# Liquid Tweet Tag for Jekyll and Octopress

This is a simple Liquid tag that makes it easy to embed tweets. This is great for quoting a tweet in a blog post,
for example. It uses Twitter's oEmbed API for their [Embedded Tweet](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/embedded-tweets)
feature. Features include:

  * Easy to install
  * Easy to embed tweets
  * Displays tweets with familiar twitter style
  * Optional parameters to control layout (as described in [Twitter's oEmbed API](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/get/statuses/oembed))
  * Provides twitter features such as retweet, follow, and favorite without leaving your page

# How To Install

  1. Copy `tweet_tag.rb` into `<your-jekyll-project>/_plugins` or `<your-ocotpress-project>/plugins`.
  2. That is all.

# How To use

Place a `tweet` tag in your content file, using the URL to the tweet, e.g.:
```
{% tweet https://twitter.com/DEVOPS_BORAT/statuses/159849628819402752 %}
```

You can also just copy the Wordpress shortcode generated by Twitter's "Embed this Tweet" UI and change
the `[...]` to `{% ... %}`. For example:
```
{% tweet https://twitter.com/DEVOPS_BORAT/status/159849628819402752 align='right' width='350' %}
```

The first argument to the `tweet` tag must be the tweet URL, but everything after that is optional. You can pass
any parameter supported by the [Twitter oEmbed API](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/get/statuses/oembed) in the form
`key='value'`.

In an attempt to maintain compatibility with Robert BÃ¶hnke's [Embed.ly Tag](https://github.com/robb/jekyll-embedly-client),
the `tweet` tag wraps the embedded code with a `<div class='embed tweet'>`.

## Markdown renderer

The default markdown engine used by Jekyll (~1.2) is the `maruku` markdown renderer which has problems parsing the html content returned from Twitter API and throws an exception (see issue #5). Suggest using the `redcarpet` engine instead by specifying this in `_config.yml` if you experience any problems.

```yaml
markdown: redcarpet
```

# Caching

The Twitter oEmbed API is rate-limited. The `tweet` tag caches all API responses in a directory named `.tweet-cache`.
This way, regenerating your site does not re-query for every embedded tweet every time. You can safely delete the
`.tweet-cache` directory. It will be recreated and embedded tweets will be re-queried.

You can also use the `tweetnocache` tag to embed a tweet that bypasses the cache. This is not recommended since
it will request the embed code from twitter every time that page is regenerated.
